ERD Entity relational diagram (for complicated project):
- to show tables relationship in between

User: {
    username
    password
    likes: [postId]
}

Post: {
    title,
    content,
    likes, (number)
    comments, (number)
    hashtags, ([ObjectId]) -> limit the number to display, can save ObjectId because the number is limited
    user,
    createdAt,
    updatedAt,
    isDeleted,
    deletedAt,
}

Comment: {
    user,
    content,
    post,
    likes,
    createdAt,
    updatedAt,

    (thread,
    replies,
    parentComment,
    depth,)
}

Hashtag: {
    name,
    (description,)
    createdAt,
    postsCount (number),
    recentPosts[]
}

* likes -> for easy to manage, so we create an individual table
if likes reach thousands level, the performance will drop dramatically

likes: {
    user,
    targetType (post, comment),
    targetId,
    post, -> what comments I liked in this open post
    createdAt
}
